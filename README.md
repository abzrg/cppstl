# C++ STL Examples

Examples of STL for me to learn and review back.


- Containers: A collection of elements
- Algorithms: Operation on elements
- Iterators: Abstraction for accessing containers in a sequential or random access manner. Different ways to maneuver through containers
  - A pair of iterators (begin and end) make a range


These are different things:

- STL
- C++ Standard Library
- C++ Core language
